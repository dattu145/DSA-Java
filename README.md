# DSA + LeetCode in Java

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** learning repository.

This repository contains my structured DSA preparation in **Java**, where I solve problems from platforms like **LeetCode** and organize them by:

- Concept (Arrays, Sliding Window, Two Pointers, etc.)
- Difficulty (Easy / Medium / Hard)

The goal is to build deep problem-solving ability and prepare for software engineering interviews.

## Repository Structure

The repository follows a **concept-first structure**, and each concept contains problems categorized by difficulty.

This structure allows:
- Clear revision by concept
- Tracking difficulty progression
- Easy scalability when adding Trees, Graphs, DP, etc.

## Concepts Covered So Far

- Arrays
- Sliding Window
- Two Pointers
- Sorting Algorithms
- Binary Search
- String-based Problems
- Java Collections Framework
- Programming Fundamentals

More concepts (LinkedList, Stack, Queue, Trees, Graphs, DP, Greedy) will be added progressively.

---

## Goals

- Master core DSA patterns
- Improve problem-solving speed and accuracy
- Prepare for SDE roles
- Build consistency with daily coding
- Transition from Easy → Medium → Hard confidently

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java
- **Platform:** LeetCode
- **Tools:** VS Code, Git, Linux

---

## Study Approach

- Practice problems concept-wise
- Gradually increase difficulty
- Maintain notes for patterns
- Revise previously solved problems weekly
- Focus on understanding patterns over memorizing solutions

---

## Why This Structure?

Instead of separating only by difficulty, this repo uses:

> Concept → Difficulty → Problems

This mirrors real interview preparation, where:
- Interviewers test patterns
- Difficulty increases gradually
- Concept clarity matters more than quantity
